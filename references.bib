  abstract = {Federated analytics seeks to compute accurate statistics from data distributed across users' devices while providing a suitable privacy guarantee and being practically feasible to implement and scale. In this paper, we show how a strong \$({\textbackslash}epsilon, {\textbackslash}delta)\$-Differential Privacy (DP) guarantee can be achieved for the fundamental problem of histogram generation in a federated setting, via a highly practical sampling-based procedure that does not add noise to disclosed data. Given the ubiquity of sampling in practice, we thus obtain a DP guarantee almost for free, avoid over-estimating histogram counts, and allow easy reasoning about how privacy guarantees may obscure minorities and outliers. Using such histograms, related problems such as heavy hitters and quantiles can be answered with provable error and privacy guarantees. Experimental results show that our sample-and-threshold approach is accurate and scalable.},

  abstract = {An exciting new development in differential privacy is the shuffled model, in which an anonymous channel enables non-interactive, differentially private protocols with error much smaller than what is possible in the local model, while relying on weaker trust assumptions than in the central model. In this paper, we study basic counting problems in the shuffled model and establish separations between the error that can be achieved in the single-message shuffled model and in the shuffled model with multiple messages per user. For the problem of frequency estimation for \$n\$ users and a domain of size \$B\$, we obtain: - A nearly tight lower bound of \${\textbackslash}tilde\{{\textbackslash}Omega\}( {\textbackslash}min({\textbackslash}sqrt[4]\{n\}, {\textbackslash}sqrt\{B\}))\$ on the error in the single-message shuffled model. This implies that the protocols obtained from the amplification via shuffling work of Erlingsson et al. (SODA 2019) and Balle et al. (Crypto 2019) are essentially optimal for single-message protocols. A key ingredient in the proof is a lower bound on the error of locally-private frequency estimation in the low-privacy (aka high \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$) regime. - Protocols in the multi-message shuffled model with \$poly({\textbackslash}log\{B\}, {\textbackslash}log\{n\})\$ bits of communication per user and \$poly{\textbackslash}log\{B\}\$ error, which provide an exponential improvement on the error compared to what is possible with single-message algorithms. For the related selection problem on a domain of size \$B\$, we prove: - A nearly tight lower bound of \${\textbackslash}Omega(B)\$ on the number of users in the single-message shuffled model. This significantly improves on the \${\textbackslash}Omega(B{\textasciicircum}\{1/17\})\$ lower bound obtained by Cheu et al. (Eurocrypt 2019), and when combined with their \${\textbackslash}tilde\{O\}({\textbackslash}sqrt\{B\})\$-error multi-message protocol, implies the first separation between single-message and multi-message protocols for this problem.},

  abstract = {Differential privacy (DP) is a formal notion for quantifying the privacy loss of algorithms. Algorithms in the central model of DP achieve high accuracy but make the strongest trust assumptions whereas those in the local DP model make the weakest trust assumptions but incur substantial accuracy loss. The shuffled DP model (Bittau et al., 2017; Erlingsson et al., 2019; Cheu et al., 2019) has recently emerged as a feasible middle ground between the central and local models, providing stronger trust assumptions than the former while promising higher accuracies than the latter. In this paper, we obtain practical communication-efficient algorithms in the shuffled DP model for two basic aggregation primitives used in machine learning: 1) binary summation, and 2) histograms over a moderate number of buckets. Our algorithms achieve accuracy that is arbitrarily close to that of central DP algorithms with an expected communication per user essentially matching what is needed without any privacy constraints! We demonstrate the practicality of our algorithms by experimentally comparing their performance to several widely-used protocols such as Randomized Response (Warner, 1965) and RAPPOR (Erlingsson et al., 2014).},

  abstract = {Sensitive statistics are often collected across sets of users, with repeated collection of reports done over time. For example, trends in users' private preferences or software usage may be monitored via such reports. We study the collection of such statistics in the local differential privacy (LDP) model, and describe an algorithm whose privacy cost is polylogarithmic in the number of changes to a user's value. More fundamentally---by building on anonymity of the users' reports---we also demonstrate how the privacy cost of our LDP algorithm can actually be much lower when viewed in the central model of differential privacy. We show, via a new and general privacy amplification technique, that any permutation-invariant algorithm satisfying \${\textbackslash}varepsilon\$-local differential privacy will satisfy \$(O({\textbackslash}varepsilon {\textbackslash}sqrt\{{\textbackslash}log(1/{\textbackslash}delta)/n\}), {\textbackslash}delta)\$-central differential privacy. By this, we explain how the high noise and \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{n\}\$ overhead of LDP protocols is a consequence of them being significantly more private in the central model. As a practical corollary, our results imply that several LDP-based industrial deployments may have much lower privacy cost than their advertised \${\textbackslash}varepsilon\$ would indicate---at least if reports are anonymized.},

  abstract = {This paper presents Poplar, a new system for solving the private heavy-hitters problem. In this problem, there are many clients and a small set of data-collection servers. Each client holds a private bitstring. The servers want to recover the set of all popular strings, without learning anything else about any client's string. A web-browser vendor, for instance, can use Poplar to figure out which homepages are popular, without learning any user's homepage. We also consider the simpler private subset-histogram problem, in which the servers want to count how many clients hold strings in a particular set without revealing this set to the clients. Poplar uses two data-collection servers and, in a protocol run, each client send sends only a single message to the servers. Poplar protects client privacy against arbitrary misbehavior by one of the servers and our approach requires no public-key cryptography (except for secure channels), nor general-purpose multiparty computation. Instead, we rely on incremental distributed point functions, a new cryptographic tool that allows a client to succinctly secret-share the labels on the nodes of an exponentially large binary tree, provided that the tree has a single non-zero path. Along the way, we develop new general tools for providing malicious security in applications of distributed point functions.},

In particular, the chapters explain aspects of garbled circuits, public-key cryptography, pseudorandom functions, one-way functions, homomorphic encryption, the simulation proof technique, and the complexity of differential privacy. Most chapters progress methodically through motivations, foundations, definitions, major results, issues surrounding feasibility, surveys of recent developments, and suggestions for further study. This book honors Professor Oded Goldreich, a pioneering scientist, educator, and mentor. Oded was instrumental in laying down the foundations of cryptography, and he inspired the contributing authors, Benny Applebaum, Boaz Barak, Andrej Bogdanov, Iftach Haitner, Shai Halevi, Yehuda Lindell, Alon Rosen, and Salil Vadhan, themselves leading researchers on the theory of cryptography and computational complexity. The book is appropriate for graduate tutorials and seminars, and for self-study by experienced researchers, assuming prior knowledge of the theory of cryptography},

Each Prio client holds a private data value (e.g., its current location), and a small set of servers compute statistical functions over the values of all clients (e.g., the most popular location). As long as at least one server is honest, the Prio servers learn nearly nothing about the clients' private data, except what they can infer from the aggregate statistics that the system computes. To protect functionality in the face of faulty or malicious clients, Prio uses secret-shared non-interactive proofs (SNIPs), a new cryptographic technique that yields a hundred-fold performance improvement over conventional zero-knowledge approaches. Prio extends classic private aggregation techniques to enable the collection of a large class of useful statistics. For example, Prio can perform a least-squares regression on high-dimensional client-provided data without ever seeing the data in the clear.},

  isbn = {978-3-642-32009-5},
  abstract = {We propose a general multiparty computation protocol secure against an active adversary corrupting up to \$\$n-1\$\$of the n players. The protocol may be used to compute securely arithmetic circuits over any finite field \$\${\textbackslash}mathbb \{F\}\_\{p{\textasciicircum}k\}\$\$. Our protocol consists of a preprocessing phase that is both independent of the function to be computed and of the inputs, and a much more efficient online phase where the actual computation takes place. The online phase is unconditionally secure and has total computational (and communication) complexity linear in n, the number of players, where earlier work was quadratic in n. Moreover, the work done by each player is only a small constant factor larger than what one would need to compute the circuit in the clear. We show this is optimal for computation in large fields. In practice, for 3 players, a secure 64-bit multiplication can be done in 0.05 ms. Our preprocessing is based on a somewhat homomorphic cryptosystem. We extend a scheme by Brakerski et al., so that we can perform distributed decryption and handle many values in parallel in one ciphertext. The computational complexity of our preprocessing phase is dominated by the public-key operations, we need \$\$O(n{\textasciicircum}2/s)\$\$operations per secure multiplication where s is a parameter that increases with the security parameter of the cryptosystem. Earlier work in this model needed \$\${\textbackslash}varOmega (n{\textasciicircum}2)\$\$operations. In practice, the preprocessing prepares a secure 64-bit multiplication for 3 players in about 13 ms.},

  abstract = {Consider an abstract storage device \${\textbackslash}Sigma({\textbackslash}mathcal\{G\})\$that can hold a single element x from a fixed, publicly known finite group \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{G\}\$. Storage is private in the sense that an adversary does not have read access to \${\textbackslash}Sigma({\textbackslash}mathcal\{G\})\$at all. However, \${\textbackslash}Sigma({\textbackslash}mathcal\{G\})\$is non-robust in the sense that the adversary can modify its contents by adding some offset \${\textbackslash}Delta {\textbackslash}in {\textbackslash}mathcal\{G\}\$. Due to the privacy of the storage device, the value Δ can only depend on an adversary’s a priori knowledge of x. We introduce a new primitive called an algebraic manipulation detection (AMD) code, which encodes a source s into a value x stored on \${\textbackslash}Sigma({\textbackslash}mathcal\{G\})\$so that any tampering by an adversary will be detected. We give a nearly optimal construction of AMD codes, which can flexibly accommodate arbitrary choices for the length of the source s and security level. We use this construction in two applications:},
